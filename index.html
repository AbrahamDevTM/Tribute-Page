                <h2>Here's some wonderful achievements Dr. Einstein has made</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Albert Einstein was a famous physicist. His research spanned from quantum mechanics to theories about gravity and motion.</li>
                    <li>After publishing some groundbreaking papers, Einstein toured the world and gave speeches about his discoveries.</li>
                    <li>In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his discovery of the photoelectric effect</li>
                    <li>Albert Einstein is best known for his equation E = mc2, which states that energy and mass (matter) are the same thing, just in different forms</li>
                    <li>Albert Einstein had a massive influence on contemporary physics. His theory of relativity shifted contemporary understanding of space completely.</li>
                    <li>Einsteinâ€™s understanding of light as something which can function both as a wave and as a stream of particles became the basis for what is known today as quantum mechanics.</li>
                    <li>Einstein suggested an Alternate Big Bang Theory</li>
                </ul>
